<h1 class="title">About CoderzHub</h1>

<br>
<p class="body">
Welcome to CoderzHub, a site made for programmers by programmers. We are dedicated to providing a way for every professional, student, and hobbyist
to link with like-minded people and do what they love to do: code. 
</p>
<br>
<p class="body"> 
CoderzHub was created during Fresno, California's 5th annual 59 Days of Code competition. Originally meant to be used as a tool for computer science majors to connect with each other
and form online study groups, the idea evolved into a social network for all programmers. We encourage users to be inventive, ask and answer questions about code or programming langauges, and to collaborate on projects.
